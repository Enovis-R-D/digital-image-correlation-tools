Tools to acquire images and post-process results for DICe

I used Justin Blaber's project (https://github.com/justinblaber/multi_pyspin) as a template as well as FLIR's example acquisition code to make a Kivy stereo image acquistion GUI.
Run that by running dic-tools/stereo_gui.py. 

There are no other tools currently in the repository, but others may be added as I find need for them.
